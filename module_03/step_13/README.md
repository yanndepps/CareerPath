# Conditionals

## [code](app.js)

## about

  - often in programming you have to pose a question to your program,
    such as asking if a certain variable is true or false, and then
    executing a specific piece of code depending on the outcome.
    conditionals in Javascript (and other programming languages) allows
    us to have our program evaluate a question and respond accordingly.

<!-- end list -->

``` javascript
if (true) {
 console.log('true');
} else {
 console.log('false');
}
```

## comparison operator
