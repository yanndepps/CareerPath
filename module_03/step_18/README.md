# conventions

-   conventions in programming are rules that developers follow that make the language easier to read and understand by other developers and yourself. while not following some of these conventions won&rsquo;t break your code, it may cause other developers to want to break your code. so lets learn some of these rules so everyone can be happy.

-   casing -> camelCased
    
    ```js
    let lastName;
    ```

-   white space -> keeps things easy to read (JS doesn&rsquo;t *need* it though)
-   naming -> name a variable what it is (common sense)
    
    ```js
    const firstName = 'Nate';
    const friends = [];
    let isDone = true;
    let isGameOver = false;
    function sum(num1, num2) {
        //---
    }
    ```

-   braces
-   tab (indenting) -> JS statement inside of other statements should be indented to show that they are properties of that statement
-   comments
    
    ```js
    // this is a comment
    /*
    anything in between these are commented out
    */
    ```

-   unix casing -> silly<sub>cia</sub> (no spaces)

-   assignment - daily planet editor

-   you&rsquo;re the new editor of the Daily Planet, and you&rsquo;re committed to bringing the newspaper up to a modern-day standard. in order to do this, you&rsquo;re moving the paper online and are teaching all the Planet&rsquo;s writers to code.

-   as the editor, each piece of code needs to pass your desk for your approval before being shown to the public. your job is to check for the following issues in every program that comes across your desk:

-   is the writer using variables correctly?
-   is the writer using operators correctly?
-   is the writer spelling things correctly? (misspelled programs don&rsquo;t just look bad, they can break!)
-   is the writer following best practices with JavaScript code conventions?

-   [code](app.js)
