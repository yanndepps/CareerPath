# challenge : social js

-   practice objects by creating a model to represent the database of a new social media platform.
-   create a model to represent the database of a new social media platform you&rsquo;re creating. it can be about whatever you want, but it needs the following:
    -   at least 3 nested levels of data (including objects and arrays)
    -   at least 1 method
    -   span across at least 50 lines of code. (No empty lines)
    -   example:

```js
const mountainClimber = {
    name: "Bob",
    age: 31,
    favoriteClimbs: [],
    mountainClimbingFriends: [
        {
            name: "Sarah",
            age: 31,
            favoriteClimbs: [
                {
                    climbName: "Mount Everest",
                    difficulty: 10
                },
                ... etc ...
            ]
        },
        {

        }
    ]
}
```

-   after you create the base object, you need to:
    -   add 2 properties to one of the objects (doesn&rsquo;t matter what level of nested data you do this to)
    -   add 2 items to at least one of the arrays in your data

-   [code](app.js)
