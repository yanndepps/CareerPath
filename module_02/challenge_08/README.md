# Challenge 08

## Containing and centering the content

- we always want to prevent content from stretching from one side of the page to the other on large screens
- it's less inviting and harder to read
- wrap all the content of the **main** element inside a **div**
- give it a width to stop it from becoming too wide
- make it centered on the page
