  <h1 style="color: #FFFD01; text-align: center;">From Vice to Crime</h1>
  <h2 style="color: #6D5ACF">European empires were addicted to opium smoking. Then their own agents launched a moral crusade to prohibit it </h2>
  <p style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>C</strong>onsuming <strong>opium</strong> was once a <em>tolerated</em> vice in Southeast Asia. Nowhere was it universally accepted, but it was also not an absolute evil. Sovereigns banned opium, yet royal troops could receive supplies deemed necessary for morale. Religious authorities proscribed the drug, yet a Buddhist monk in Burma could legitimately use it during <em>tattooing rituals</em>. <strong>Opium</strong> was a ‘sinister friend’ to the Javanese that could at once drag them into penury, and ease the pain and discomforts of life’s necessary labours. Across the Malay archipelago, village elders frowned upon <strong>opium</strong> smokers as lazy and apathetic even as their communities shared <strong>opium</strong> pipes in private homes, at public gatherings to enjoy what one European visitor called ‘such a tickling in [the] Blood, such a languishing delight … that it justly might be termed <em>a Pleasure too great for human Nature to support’</em>. </p>
  <p style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>F</strong>or centuries, <strong>opium’s</strong> place in everyday life across Southeast Asia had been shaped through a variety of political, legal, religious and cultural practices, which also established boundaries of transgression in fluid ways. Smoking <strong>opium</strong> was a sumptuary practice with many possible meanings – from an analgesic, curative medicine and aphrodisiac to a depraved habit and immoral indulgence. The habit was not necessarily widespread but still far-reaching, capable of touching the lives of the powerful and the meek, the pious and the profane, the rich and the poor alike. And <strong>opium</strong> itself could be ‘at once bountiful and all-devouring, merciful and destructive, sustaining and vengeful’, as the Indian novelist Amitav Ghosh put it in Sea of Poppies (2008).</p>
  <h2 style="color: #6D5ACF">At the stroke of Smeaton’s pen, the colony’s number of people affected by opium increased by fivefold</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>D</strong>onald Mackenzie Smeaton was a British bureaucrat stationed in Burma since 1879. He calculated that nearly 11 per cent of Lower Burma’s population were harmed by <strong>opium</strong> smoking. Smeaton used the term ‘morally wrecked’ to categorise such colonial subjects. This turn of phrase, and Smeaton’s quantitative estimates of the toll of <strong>opium</strong> on lives, would play a powerful role in guiding the British colonial state toward banning popular <strong>opium</strong> consumption in 1894, the first anti-<strong>opium</strong> reform of its kind in a European colony in Southeast Asia.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>S</strong>meaton was a careful administrator. He began by calculating the number of <strong>opium</strong> users in his jurisdiction, using two sources: statistical records from Burma’s jails since the 1870s and a colony-wide survey of <strong>opium</strong> consumers. Based on these official records, Smeaton estimated that there were around 85,000 adult Burmese males who used <strong>opium</strong>, which was less than 1 per cent of the total enumerated population. He reasoned that this figure undercounted users because the survey would capture only the ‘most notorious consumers’. Smeaton was a collegial official, attentive to what his fellow administrators thought. The commissioner of Arakan had ‘long and intimate acquaintance with the province and people [of Burma] and who [had] taken pains in the inquiry’. He was ‘convinced that the <strong>opium</strong> consuming population is much higher’. Smeaton agreed.</p>
